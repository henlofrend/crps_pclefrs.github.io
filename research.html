            <h1>Research</h1>
            <p>We are a research active team.  It is an important part of our service, as we undertake a wide range of projects to give us a better understanding of CRPS.  Our specialist areas of interest are the mechanisms behind CRPS, patient experience of living with the condition, and new treatment interventions.  Currently we are testing the process of collecting an internationally agreed core set of outcome measures and hope to develop an international registry for CRPS in the future.   We are involved in a number of regional, national and international research groups that either have a focus on CRPS or more generalised chronic pain.  We also present our research findings at conferences via posters, workshops or as invited speakers.</p>
            <p>Participation in all of our research is voluntary.  In order to be considered for one of our studies, you will need to complete and sign a research consent form at some point in your patient journey with us.</p>
            <p>The UK CRPS Registry is a national database of people with CRPS and a long-term research study.  We are responsible for the administration of this valuable information resource of behalf of the CRPS UK Clinical & Research Network, in addition to being one of ten recruiting centres around the UK who contribute data.  Our researchers are all members of the Network and links to key research papers that we have published since 2009 are available from <a href="https://crpsnetworkuk.org">crpsnetworkuk.org</a></p>
            <p>Current research studies include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Core Outcome Measures for complex regional PAin Clinical sTudies (COMPACT)</strong>, sponsored by the Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust. Currently it is difficult to bring research findings from many different studies together.  This is because researchers may not always use the same questionnaires to measure change during a clinical study.  The aim of this study is to agree on a minimum core set of outcome measures which will be recommended for use in all CRPS clinical studies.  The development of a core measurement set would make it easier to compare data to answer specific research questions agreed as internationally important and relevant for the advance of the treatment of CRPS.</li>
                <li><strong>Treating chronic pain by using visual illusions to modulate body perception disturbance</strong>, sponsored by the University of the West of England.  Research previously carried out by a member of the team explored a drug-free approach for the relief of persistent pain, by using visual manipulation techniques.  However, the brain processes responsible for this pain reduction during the illusion are currently unknown.  The aim of this new project is to better understand brain processes involved in pain and altered body perception, as well as how this impacts on the lives of people with CRPS and hand osteoarthritis.</li>
                <li><strong>Development of an Electrical Sensory Discrimination Therapies Device to aid reduction of neuropathic pain</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Physical, occupational performance and emotional impacts of living with CRPS or Complex Cancer Late Effects</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The NHS Health Research Authority (HRA) has published information for patients relating to health and care research.  This can be accessed from their website via the following link – <a href="https://www.hra.nhs.uk/information-about-patients">www.hra.nhs.uk/information-about-patients</a></p>
            <p>In addition to research, we ask patients to complete a number of questionnaires before they attend their first appointment and at various points throughout the pathway.  This is an important aspect of our programme for our patients and NHS commissioners.</p>

            <h1>Education & Visitors</h1>
            <article>
                <h2>Update regarding COVID-19</h2>
                In line with current hospital and NHS operational needs, we need to ensure that the hospital remains a safe place for our patients.  This means that we do not have any events or training courses planned.  We are also unable to offer any dates for professional or observational visits until further notice.  We will update this page when we have any further information relating to our services.
            </article>
            <p>Education and training for healthcare professionals forms an integral part of our work, so that we can increase understanding of the conditions we treat and share best practice.  We hold specialist study days and conferences for healthcare professionals from time to time.</p>
            <p>Visitor opportunities are dependent upon our levels of activity throughout the year.  Visits don’t usually offer any form of hands-on patient contact, but they may include an opportunity to observe clinical work (subject to patient consent).  Please note that that some pre-employment checks, including DBS and occupational health, will need to be undertaken ahead of your visit to us.  There is no charge for professional or study visits, but you will be expected to cover your own travel and accommodation costs.</p>
            <p>If you are interested in visiting the service, please download and complete the application form below and return it to us along with a copy of your current CV/biography:<br />
            <a href="resources/CRPSPCLEFRSVisitorsapplication.docx">CRPS & PCLFERS Visitors' Application Form</a></p>
            <p>We would be grateful if you could provide a few date options for your availability where possible, so that we can ensure the visit is arranged at a time that will be most beneficial to you.  If you have a specific interest in a particular area of our work, then please also include any relevant details in your application.</p>
            <p>All visitor enquiries and completed application forms should be directed in the first instance to:
                <br /><a href="mailto:ruh-tr.RNHRDCRPSteam@nhs.net">ruh-tr.RNHRDCRPSteam@nhs.net</a> for CRPS visitors

            <p>Our service has recently relocated from Bath city centre to the RNHRD & Brownsword Therapies Centre, which is located on the main Royal United Hospital (RUH) site in Combe Park, Bath.  We are part of the Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust. The RUH is 1.5 miles west of the city centre, in the Weston suburb.</p>
            <p>The hospital does have a small amount of public parking. Unfortunately like all hospitals, demand for parking is extremely high and we can not guarantee you'll always find a space. As a result, we always recommend that visitors leave plenty of time for their journey and consider using Park & Ride bus services or other public transport options.</p>
            <p>To explore RUH public transport options, including using rail and city centre buses, please click <a href="https://www.ruh.nhs.uk/finding/public_transport.asp">here</a></p>
            <p>If driving to the Hospital is the only feasible mode of transport, click <a href="https://www.ruh.nhs.uk/finding/car_parking.asp">here</a> to find out more about Hospital parking charges and click <a href="https://www.ruh.nhs.uk/finding/car_parking_payment.asp">here</a> for methods of payment.</p>
            <p>Please note that if you are a disabled badge holder, you are entitled to park free of charge in designated spaces. However, you will still need to either present your badge at main reception for exemption or telephone 01225 826274 prior to arriving at the hospital. Further details on this process can be found here.</p>
            <p>If you have specific questions related to Hospital parking, please visit the RUH parking specific <a href="https://www.ruh.nhs.uk/finding/car_parking_FAQ.asp">FAQs</a> or call 01225 826274 / e-mail <a href="mailto:ruh-tr.carparking@nhs.net">ruh-tr.carparking@nhs.net</a></p>

            <h1>Our Privacy Policy for this website</h1>
            <p>We hold limited personal information for registered account users – this is necessary to set up and maintain user website accounts.  The administrative team member responsible for the website will only use this information to contact registered users about important website updates or to help with any technical issues.   Our website is hosted by the external company who developed it for us and data is securely stored through their servers.</p>
            <p>We collect anonymous data via Google Analytics in order to help us to review how the website is being used.  This is important to help us to evaluate the service we provide and to look at how we might wish to develop the website in the future.  We may use this data to report statistics such as how many people are using the website, which sections are popular or those that are not used so regularly, what general type of device people use (e.g. computer, tablet or mobile phone), and how long on average people spend on the website.  These statistics may be published as part of conference posters or reports in the future, but they will always remain anonymised.  Google Analytics provides us with a unique identifier for each website user, which means that we can’t identify who you are.</p>
            <p>We may also contact registered account holders occasionally by email to take part in questionnaires about their experience of using the website.  Again, this will be done anonymously and registered users can choose whether or not they wish to be offered the opportunity to receive these questionnaires.</p>
            <p>The Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust has produced a general privacy notice for patients, which summarises the types of personal and confidential information we hold and the reasons why.  This covers all aspects of our hospital records and systems, rather than specifically what we do for the website, but it can be viewed by using the link <a href="https://www.ruh.nhs.uk/privacy/index.asp">www.ruh.nhs.uk/privacy/index.asp</a></p>

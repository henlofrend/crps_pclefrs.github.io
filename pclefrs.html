            <h1>The Pain-related Cancer Late Effects Functional Rehabilitation Service</h1>
            <p>The Pain-related Cancer Late Effects Functional Rehabilitation Service (PCLEFRS) is a national, highly-specialised, multi-disciplinary rehabilitation service for people experiencing severe, persistent pain and reduced physical function due to the consequences of treatment for cancer, including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. People with pain-related, functional late effects need to be at least year post active treatment and have already seen local pain, rehabilitation and/or late effects services without improvement in their symptoms.</p>
            <p>For more information on specific Referral Criteria – please click <a href="pclefrs-ref.html">here</a>.</p>
            </p>
            <p>PCLEFRS brings the Complex Cancer Late Effects Rehabilitation Service and the Breast Radiation Injury Rehabilitation Service under one umbrella with a focus on specialist, holistic rehabilitation. The aim of the service is to improve function and quality of life, enabling people to engage in valued activities and acquire confidence to manage their symptoms better in the longer term.</p>
            <p>Following referral, PCLEFRS patients may be offered:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A telephone triage with a Macmillan Clinical Nurse Specialist</li>
                <li>Assessments with a Pain Consultant, Clinical Nurse Specialist, Clinical Psychologist, Specialist Physiotherapist and Occupational Therapist in a multidisciplinary assessment clinic</li>
                <li>A tailored rehabilitation programme, where appropriate, which includes specialist therapy and education based on individual goals delivered in group and one to one sessions.</li>
            </ul>

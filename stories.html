            <p>"I feel that my condition is real and has been recognised. I feel that the various therapies we have been introduced to will give me some confidence to self-manage."</p>
            <p>"I now understand my condition more fully. I feel more in control of my condition and my life."</p>

            <h3>What patients have said about our PCLEFRS programme</h3>
            <p>“I have new tools to move forward in a sustainable, safe and ‘simple and sticky’ way. More confidence to actually DO rehabilitation with my body as it is. I felt heard, seen and listened to.”</p>
            <p>“Being more flexible has meant I have experienced less pain. I have learnt so many skills to take away and embed into my daily life that will make it easier and more pleasurable. This has made me feel more confident and positive. I’ve felt very much that everything has been tailored to my needs, which has given it a very personal approach.”</p>

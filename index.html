            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <p>
                We provide two nationally-commissioned highly-specialist functional rehabilitation services:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS Service)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>The Pain-related Cancer Late Effects Functional Rehabilitation Service (PCLEFRS)</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our internationally-recognised and therapist-led team specialises in non-medical management of these complex persistent pain conditions, focusing on improving function and empowering people to manage their condition well and improve their quality of life.</p>
            <p>Our specialist team includes a pain consultant, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, a clinical psychologist, and a clinical nurse specialist.</p>
            <p>We offer a specialist interdisciplinary assessment clinic and for those who are appropriate, we provide a two-week bespoke functional rehabilitation programme.</p>
            <p>We are based at the RNHRD & Brownsword Therapies Centre, which is part of the <a href="https://www.ruh.nhs.uk">Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust</a>.</p>
            <h2>The Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) Service</h2>
            <p>Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a persistent pain condition that can cause a range of unpleasant symptoms that usually affect a single limb but sometimes other areas of the body. As one of the first services specialising in this field, we have extensive experience of treating CRPS.</p>
            <p>For more information about our CRPS service, click <a href="crps.html">here</a>.</p>
            <h2>The Pain-related Cancer Late Effects Functional Rehabilitation Service (PCLEFRS)</h2>
            <p>The Pain-related Cancer Late Effects Functional Rehabilitation Service (PCLEFRS) supports adults with persistent pain and reduced physical function caused by their surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy treatment for cancer.  PCLEFRS encompasses the Breast Radiation Injury Rehabilitation Service (BRIRS) and the Complex Cancer Late Effects Rehabilitation Service (CCLERS) and now can receive referrals for patients suffering late effects from any of these cancer treatments at any cancer site. People need to be at least a year post active treatment.</p>
            <p>For more information about PCLEFRS, click <a href="pclefrs.html">here</a>.</p>

            <h1>Important update regarding COVID-19</h1>
            <p>We are pleased to announce that our CRPS and PCLEFRS services are still running in the current COVID-19 climate. We realise that for the majority, the last few months will have been unsettling. We are committed to supporting patients to access our specialist services.

Please bear with us as we continue to develop innovative new ways of working.</p>

            <h3>COVID-19 and CRPS â€“ Advice for patients</h3>
            <p>Many patients with CRPS may be worried regarding their vulnerability to COVID-19.  There is no evidence of any specific vulnerability for patients with CRPS or chronic pain. However, we advise that all patients with CRPS diligently follow the Government guidelines on social distancing and frequent hand washing.  The guidance changes daily so check the Public Health England website for current advice: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england">www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england</a></p>
            <p>We will update this page when we have any further information relating to our services.  For the current NHS advice and guidance regarding COVID-19, please visit: <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19">www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19</a></p>

            <h1>Our Referral Process</h1>
            <p>The CRPS and Complex Late Effects services are both provided on a national basis for adults aged 18 years or over.  If you live in England, then this is currently funded as a national specialist service via NHS England.  If you live elsewhere in the UK, then special funding will need to be obtained by your GP or local pain consultant before you are referred.  We are also able to accept private referrals.<br /><br />
